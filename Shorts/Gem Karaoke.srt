1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,900
我在录像
谢谢，Connie！

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,480
OK，是56383

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,840
5-6-3

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,200
快点放歌啊，P！

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,560
[未完成]我等不及了

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,400
Amethyst，我很努力了

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,880
Steven,你确定是“车牌”是对的吗？

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,680
我一直在尝试输入但并没有播放

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,120
哦，你得点“开车”

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,740
原来如此

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,260
爽！Connie，歌开始了

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,020
要不...你们先唱

13
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,380
你确定吗？

14
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,040
没什么，总得有人录像吧？

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,540
Oh...好吧（我是程序狗，翻译烂别骂我）

16
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,260
我难免引人注目
I can't help it if I make a scene,

17
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,160
即使走下我的艳粉礼车
Stepping out of my hot pink limousine.

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,220
我甩甩头就能阻塞车流
I'm turning heads, and I'm stopping traffic,

19
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,660
万众为造型尖叫，为玩笑捧腹
When I pose, they scream, and when I joke, they laugh.

20
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,740
我有一双令人失神的眼
I've got a pair of eyes that they're getting lost in,

21
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,420
魔鬼的步伐迷惑人心
They're hypnotized by the way I'm walking,

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,460
犹如魔术师般炫目
I've got them dazzled like a stage magician,

23
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,820
万众望我所指，听我谈笑风生When I point, they look, and when I talk, they listen, well,

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,520
大家都需要朋友
Everybody needs a friend,

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,120
而我有你和你和你
And I've got you and you and you

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,960
如此之多都忘记名字
So many, I can't even name them,

27
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,020
谁叫我如此有名
Can you blame me? I'm too famous.

28
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,320
Connie？Connie，来吧，高潮要出来了

29
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,680
Oh,没什么，你们玩的High就好

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,140
来吧，该你了

31
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,300
你确定？

32
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,120
Yeah！玩玩吧

33
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,120
好吧，谢谢，Garnet

34
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,360
你是否注意我是那天上明星？
Haven't you noticed that I'm a star?

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,000
当地球旋转我进入你的视野
I'm coming into view as the world is turning.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,900
你是否注意到我已如此成功？
Haven't you noticed I've made it this far?

37
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,180
现在所有人能看我闪耀
Now, everyone can see me burning. 

38
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,460
现在所有人能看我闪耀
Now, everyone can see me burning. 

39
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,020
Connie，唱的不赖嘛

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,600
谢谢，Pearl
你真是个K歌禽兽啊

41
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,720
Oh，谢谢夸奖，我只是...

42
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,720
呃...Pearl?

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,140
你点播放前添加了多少次？

44
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,160
大概有十五次吧？

45
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,160
I'm core！
Yeah
